The value maps closely to the ISO code (BONU) defined as a bonus, scrip or capitalisation issue.

The CDM recommends the use of the globalKey and provides a default implementation which is accessible in the generated code through org.isda.cdm.globalKey.GlobalKeyHashCalculator.

Mergers and acquisitions (abbreviated M&A) is an aspect of corporate strategy, corporate finance and management dealing with the buying, selling, dividing and combining of different companies and similar entities that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its sector or location of origin, or a new field or new location, without creating a subsidiary, other child entity or using a joint venture. The distinction between a merger and an acquisition has become increasingly blurred in various respects (particularly in terms of the ultimate economic outcome), although it has not completely disappeared in all situations. The value maps closely to the ISO code (MRGR) defined as an offer made to shareholders, normally by a third party, requesting them to sell (tender) or exchange their equities."

A number of different scenarios can be supported, namely; 1) the derived date may simply be a number of calendar periods (days, weeks, months or years) preceding or following the anchor date; 2) the unadjusted derived date may be a number of calendar periods (days, weeks, months or years) preceding or following the anchor date with the resulting unadjusted derived date subject to adjustment in accordance with a specified business day convention, i.e. the derived date must fall on a good business day; 3) the derived date may be a number of business days preceding or following the anchor date. Note that the businessDayConvention specifies any required adjustment to the unadjusted derived date. A negative or positive value in the periodMultiplier indicates whether the unadjusted derived precedes or follows the anchor date. The businessDayConvention should contain a value NONE if the day type element contains a value of Business (since specifying a negative or positive business days offset would already guarantee that the derived date would fall on a good business day in the specified business centers)."
